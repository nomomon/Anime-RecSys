# Anime Recommendations

Goal of this repo is to document the development user-item recommendation systems, and learn and compare different methods of achiving that. Dataset used is [Anime Recommendation Database 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020) from Kaggle.

## Predicting User-Anime Ratings

One of the ways to recommend items is by predicting _what rating will a user put on an item_, and showing the ones that user hasn't seen and have the highest rating. There are two approaches to answer this question:
- **Colaborative filtering** – method of making predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users.
- **Content-based filtering** – method of making predictions based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.

Right now we will focus only on colaborative filtering.
